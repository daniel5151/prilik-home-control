# prilik-home-control

**UPDATE (16/07/23):** So I finally tried Home Assistant, and yeah... there's
no good reason to roll-your-own version (outside of technical curiosity). I'm
mothballing this repo for now. Do yourself a favor, and just set up Home
Assistant. It's _awesome_.

* * *

A shoddy little app/lib to do misc smart home stuff on the hodge-podge
collection of devices I own.

Think of it as my own personal [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)
type thing.

Probably not super useful to anyone who doesn't have the exact-same kinds of
appliances as I do lol.

Mostly a toy right now, though I do have vague aspirations of using this code as
the "backend" for a custom home-control GUI running on a hacked [Spotify Car
Thing](https://carthing.spotify.com/).

As is tradition with side-projects - whether or not this is something I'll keep
hacking on is _very_ TBD at this point. We'll see ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
